# ->\~\~=> Sorcery of Uvutu <=\~\~<-
Thanks for downloading Sorcery of Uvutu! This was a passion project of mine I started in 2015, developing
at that time on the TI-84+CSE calculator. I ported it to the TI-84+ monochrome series in 2016, and
ported to the PC in 2017.
Sorcery of Uvutu is an 8-bit style RPG. Play as an unknown hero trying to save his town from foreign rule.
Take up your arms and get ready to fight! Turn-based combat, 8-bit sprites, hours of gameplay, and more!


## -> Building / Running <-
To build, first:
Download SorceryOfUvutuPCbin.zip and unzip it.
Use a Command Prompt window to navigate to the location you just unzipped to and into the subfolder build.
If you're on Windows, ensure you have gcc installed and running, and run a_WindowsBuild.bat. If you don't
have gcc, you should either download it (I downloaded it as a part of minGW, but you can download gcc
however you see fit), or download and run the pre-built package. If you're on Linux, run
a_LinuxBuild.sh.
To Run:
If you didn't build, on Windows, you can navigate to the execute file and run a_makeShortcut.bat to
put a shortcut to Sorcery of Uvutu on your Desktop. Run SorceryOfUvutu.exe or double-click the shortcut
to start.
If you built, to run on Windows, you can double click on the .exe file you just built or the shortcut
on the Desktop. To run on Linux, you can execute the file you made, or type in sourun in bash from
anywhere and it'll launch.

## <> Keybinding <>
You can customize which keys you use for what. You can use any key for any task; 2 for Up, W for Down,
Q for Left, E for Right, Caps Lock for Confirm, and LShift for Menu, as an example. If you don't like
your keybinding, forgot it, or somehow it was corrupted, you can reset it to the default (WASD + Space
for Confirm, and Esc for Menu) by starting Sorcery of Uvutu and pressing Ctrl + R on the main menu.

## >> Legal Stuff <<

The word "I" refers to the creator of Sorcery of Uvutu, Stephen Policelli.
I did not write or modify the graphics library, SDL2, any of its extensions or previous versions, or any
of its code.
I did not create the font file PX_437_ITT_BIOS_X.ttf. However, I did slight modify it, adding in one
character.
I originally wrote Sorcery of Uvutu for TI-84+CSE, then for TI-84+, and then for PC.
You'll see why I mention these things if you read all of the licenses.
