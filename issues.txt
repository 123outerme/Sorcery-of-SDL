Windows:
* None reported so far

Linux:
* Seg fault whenever drawTilemap/drawTile is called (VM problem?)

Game:
* Exp gain too fast
* Move upgrader text doesn't update unless break from main loop
* 2nd Boss and up doesn't alert player of new TP stone (fixed?)
* Movement (holding left/right + up & down alternating) is not smooth
